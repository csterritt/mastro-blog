# Title: Cars in Japan, November 2025

I knew a bit about cars of Japan, but it was really something to see them in person.

The silver car on the left is a VW, sold in the US as a compact car, generally
a good bit smaller than most US cars. So you can see what are by far the most
common size of car in Japan.

My daughter's Lapin - French for rabbit - it has a rabbit logo on the front.
The decal on the hood is for the company that she works for; they provide it
to her, since she has to drive to several locations. She gets a lot of
surprised looks, but less than another person at the company whose car is
completely covered!

A lot of the streets are very narrow, about the width of a 1970's Cadillac.
Passing oncoming traffic requires a lot of politeness, but it's Japan, so no
problem there!

People usually drive at sensible speeds, given the width of the street, but not
always. The white concrete path is the sidewalk. There are a lot of
drainage/irrigation ditches, usually along the side of the street, and usually
open, so they're worth watching out for.

The cars are small, and the parking lots are also small sometimes! This
is one with exactly three parking spots. This is in the part of Takamatsu
near where we stayed, in a not particularly busy area.

And then there's this parking lot with lifts to effectively double the
number of parking spots. I have no idea what you do if you want your car,
but someone is parked below you.

The standard size of pickup in Japan. There is a fair amount of construction
in this area, as well as farming.

A "gomi shu shu sha" (garbage truck). I know the Japanese since it's my
younger grandson's favorite truck, though he has a great love of all things
truck and construction vehicle. My daughter has learned all their names in
self-defense.
