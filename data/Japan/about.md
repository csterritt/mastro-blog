We wound up missing our flight from Tokyo to Takamatsu, and ANA (All Nippon Airways)
put us up for the night in a hotel in the airport. The (incredibly helpful and polite) ANA person asked us if we had any preference for what kind of bed we wanted, and we said we'd take anything. And we got it!

Two terra-cotta cats, having quite the discussion.

Mout Fuji, from the seat of our plane. One of the in-flight options was to have a view out the front of the plane.

A walk along the edge of Ritsurin Garden. The park is to the left, and to the right
is the typical Japanese urban landscape... they don't do zoning, so there's houses
and a restaurant, with other shops and apartments nearby.

Found in a small park in the city.

A seafood restaurant sign.

Near sunset on one of the trains.

Kagawa Prefecture is pretty hilly, but bare rock is unusual to see.

This is on the top floor of our b&b. Diane caught him, and I took him over to the
grounds of a temple across the street. The temple has a beautiful bamboo grove, and
the mantis seemed happy to be there.

Morning glories.

## IDG_20251116_093016_483.jpeg

A bit of color.

## IMG_1975.jpeg

Most of the manhole covers in Takamatsu are decorated like this. I did see
one that had been painted, but didn't get a photo.

## IMG_1989.jpeg

Note the narrow white building, and the gray one behind it... elevators
aren't really a thing in housing in this area.

## IMG_2341.jpeg

Another very narrow building.

## IMG_1993.jpeg

The area where the kids live is transitioning from farmland to general
urban development. But it's kind of patchy - small plots like this are
common, sprinkled throughout the area.

## IMG_2022.jpeg

I love this umbrella print.

## IMG_2025.jpeg

We saw Totoro! Didn't get an autograph though.

## IMG_2027.jpeg

This is Gonta-kun, the tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog) mascot of the Ota Minami
district where our kids live.

This is on the train to Marugame Castle. I asked my son-in-law about the turnstile
guarding the way to the driver's position. I asked if you paid enough, could you drive the train? His reply was, "Unfortunately, no."

On the train to Marugame Castle.

## IMG_2047.jpeg

I enjoyed seeing the wide range of architectural styles in Japan.

## IMG_2108.jpeg

This train is decorated with characters from the "Anpanman" books and anime.

## IMG_2309.jpeg

Continuing the theme of "decorating trains with company products", this train
is decorated with Pokemon characters.

## IMG_2308.jpeg

Kind of amazed that they went so far as to have special fabric for the seats!

## IMG_2346.jpeg

A shopping mall, open to the elements. The climate is very mild in Takamatsu,
except for the summer, which can be very hot.

## IMG_2347.jpeg

The mall's mascot keeping an eye on things.

### Cars

As an American male I am require by federal law to pay attention to cars.

### DecorativeEnglish

The Japanese use a lot of decorative English, which is... interesting.

Marugame Castle - A beautiful castle, with a great view of the surrounding area.
